/**
 * Window sizing for the theme colour editor.
 *
 * <p>The editor previously inherited Material's default alert width, so the 13 colour
 * slots, the 3 opacity sliders and the live preview were squeezed into a narrow column
 * and the dialog covered only about 58% x 70% of a 1920x1080 screen - measured on
 * device at [405,160][1515,920]. It now follows the same contract as the ad-block
 * statistics dialog: fill the screen minus a constant safety margin.
 *
 * <p>The margin is a fixed dp value rather than a screen percentage. A percentage
 * silently changes the usable area with the panel resolution, while the editor's rows
 * have a fixed dp height and the preview needs a predictable amount of room; a fixed
 * margin keeps the same physical gutter on every device. It also keeps the dialog from
 * ever reaching the very edge of an overscanning TV panel.
 *
 * <p>The gutter is subtracted from the system-bar-safe area, not from the raw display
 * bounds. {@code ResUtil.getScreenHeight} returns the full display on API 30+, so sizing
 * the window from it pushed the footer's cancel/reset/save row under the navigation bar
 * and the buttons were cut off. {@link #safeArea} subtracts the window's status-bar,
 * navigation-bar and display-cutout insets instead, so the result stays inside every
 * system bar and any TV overscan.
